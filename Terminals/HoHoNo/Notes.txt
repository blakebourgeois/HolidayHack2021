Jack is trying to break into Santa's workshop!

Santa's elves are working 24/7 to manually look through logs, identify the
malicious IP addresses, and block them. We need your help to automate this so
the elves can get back to making presents!

Can you configure Fail2Ban to detect and block the bad IPs?

 * You must monitor for new log entries in /var/log/hohono.log
 * If an IP generates 10 or more failure messages within an hour then it must
   be added to the naughty list by running naughtylist add <ip>
        /root/naughtylist add 12.34.56.78
 * You can also remove an IP with naughtylist del <ip>
        /root/naughtylist del 12.34.56.78
 * You can check which IPs are currently on the naughty list by running
        /root/naughtylist list

You'll be rewarded if you correctly identify all the malicious IPs with a
Fail2Ban filter in /etc/fail2ban/filter.d, an action to ban and unban in
/etc/fail2ban/action.d, and a custom jail in /etc/fail2ban/jail.d. Don't
add any nice IPs to the naughty list!

*** IMPORTANT NOTE! ***

Fail2Ban won't rescan any logs it has already seen. That means it won't
automatically process the log file each time you make changes to the Fail2Ban
config. When needed, run /root/naughtylist refresh to re-sample the log file
and tell Fail2Ban to reprocess it.
