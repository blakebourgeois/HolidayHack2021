Need to set up the logic gates to light all three outputs

Six gates available:
AND (both inputs must be 1)
OR (either input can be 1)
XOR (both inputs must be different)
NAND (negated and--both inputs must be 0)
NOR (negated OR--if both inputs are 0, will return 1; otherwise returns 1)
XNOR - (negated XOR--output of 1 if both inputs are the same; otherwise returns 0)

Input 1 -> OFF -> GATE 1
Input 2 -> ON -> GATE 1 and GATE 2
Input 3 - OFF - GATE 2 and GATE 3
Input 4 - ON - GATE 4
